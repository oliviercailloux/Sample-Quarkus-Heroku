= Sample Jetty

Jetty embedded, JAX-RS with Jersey, JPA with Hibernate, CDI with Weld. Ready to be deployed to Heroku.

To deploy to Heroku, simply follow their https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java[tutorial], replacing their example application with this one: instead of `git clone \https://github.com/heroku/java-getting-started`, type `git clone \https://github.com/oliviercailloux/sample-jetty.git`.

See this (impressive) application live https://sample-jetty.herokuapp.com[here], and the (equally impressive) counter https://sample-jetty.herokuapp.com/counter[there]. (You might have to wait for about thirty seconds, the time required for Heroku to wake up the application, if it is https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#dyno-sleeping[asleep] at the time you click.)

You may want to https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/saving-repositories-with-stars#about-stars[star] this repository if you find this example useful: it will encourage me to keep it up to date.
